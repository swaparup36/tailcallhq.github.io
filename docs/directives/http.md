description: The @http directive indicates a field or node relies on a REST API.
slug: ../http-directive

The `@http` directive is defined as follows:

```graphql title="Directive Definition" showLineNumbers
directive @http(
  url: String!
  method: Method
  query: [InputKeyValue!]
  body: JSON
  headers: [InputKeyValue!]
  batchKey: [String!]
  onRequest: String
  onResponseBody: String
  select: JSON
  dedupe: Boolean
) on FIELD_DEFINITION
```

The `@http` directive indicates a field or node relies on a REST API. For example:

```graphql showLineNumbers
type Query {
  users: [User]
    @http(url: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users")
}
```

In this example, adding the `@http` directive to the `users` field of the `Query` type indicates reliance on a REST API for the `users` field. The [url](#url) argument specifies the REST API's url, which is `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users` in this scenario. Querying the `users` field prompts the GraphQL server to issue a GET request to `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`.

## url

Specifies the API's URL.

```graphql showLineNumbers
type Query {
  users: [User]
    @http(
      url: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users"
      url: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com"
    )
}
```

If your API endpoint contains dynamic segments, you can substitute variables using Mustache templates. For example, to fetch a specific user, you can write the url as `/users/{{.args.id}}`.

```graphql showLineNumbers
type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
    @http(
      url: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/{{.args.id}}"
    )
}
```

## method

Specifies the HTTP method for the API call. The default method is GET if not specified.

```graphql showLineNumbers
type Mutation {
  createUser(input: UserInput!): User
    @http(
      method: "POST"
      url: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users"
    )
}
```

## query

Represents the API call's query parameters, either as a static object or with dynamic parameters using Mustache templates. These parameters append to the URL.

```graphql showLineNumbers
type Query {
  userPosts(id: ID!): [Post]
    @http(
      url: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"
      query: [
        {
          key: "userId"
          value: "{{.args.id}}"
          skipEmpty: false
        }
      ]
    )
}
```

The `query` field and be further configured using the following fields:

1. **key** : Represents the name of the query parameter.
2. **value** : A string literal or a mustache template representing the value of query parameter.
3. **skipEmpty** : When set to `true` the query parameter is skipped if the value of the parameter is null, defaults to false.

:::important
When `batchKey` is present, Tailcall considers the first `query` parameter to be the batch query key, so remember to adjust the order of the items accordingly.
:::

## body

Defines the API call's body, necessary for methods like POST or PUT. Pass it as a static object or use Mustache templates for variable substitution from the GraphQL variables.

```graphql showLineNumbers
type Mutation {
  createUser(input: UserInput!): User
    @http(
      method: "POST"
      url: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users"
      body: "{{.args.input}}"
    )
}
```

In the example above, the `createUser` mutation sends a POST request to `/users`, with the input object converted to JSON and included in the request body.

## headers

Customizes the HTTP request headers made by the `@http` directive. Specify a key-value map of header names and values.

For instance:

```graphql showLineNumbers
type Mutation {
  createUser(input: UserInput!): User
    @http(
      url: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users"
      headers: [{key: "X-Server", value: "Tailcall"}]
    )
}
```

In this example, a request to `/users` will include a HTTP header `X-Server` with the value `Tailcall`.

You can make use of mustache templates to provide dynamic values for headers, derived from the arguments or [context] provided in the request. For example:

[context]: /docs/graphql-resolver-context-tailcall

```graphql showLineNumbers
type Mutation {
  users(name: String): User
    @http(
      url: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users"
      headers: [
        {key: "X-Server", value: "Tailcall"}
        {key: "User-Name", value: "{{.args.name}}"}
      ]
    )
}
```

In this scenario, the `User-Name` header's value will dynamically adjust according to the `name` argument passed in the request.

## batchKey

Groups data requests into a single call, enhancing efficiency. Refer to our [n + 1 guide](../N+1.md) for more details.

:::important
When `batchKey` is present, Tailcall considers the first `query` parameter to be the batch query key, so remember to adjust the order of the items accordingly. Whereas, the last item from `batchKey` is used to instruct which field is the ID of an object. In case that the returned result is a nested property `batchKey` can be used as a path to extract and group the items for the returned result.
:::

```graphql showLineNumbers
type Post {
  id: Int!
  name: String!
  user: User
    @http(
      url: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users"
      query: [{key: "user_id", value: "{{.value.userId}}"}]
      batchKey: ["users", "id"]
    )
}
```

- `query: {key: "user_id", value: "{{.value.userId}}"}]`: Instructs Tailcall CLI to generate a URL aligning the user id with `userId` from the parent `Post`, compiling a single URL for a batch of posts, such as `/users?user_id=1&user_id=2&user_id=3...user_id=10`, consolidating requests into one.

## onRequest

The `onRequest` property accepts a string value representing the remote function to be called every time an HTTP request is initiated. Typically the remote function is defined in a linked JavaScript worker file.

:::note
For defining a request middleware globally for all requests, refer to the [upstream directive documentation](./upstream.md#onrequest).
:::

```graphql showLineNumbers
type Query {
  userPosts(id: ID!): [Post]
    @http(
      url: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"
      query: [{key: "userId", value: "{{.args.id}}"}]
      onRequest: "someFunctionName"
    )
}
```

## onResponseBody

This hook allows you to intercept and modify the response body from upstream services before it's processed by Tailcall. Like [onRequest](#onrequest), it accepts a string value representing a middleware function defined in a JavaScript file. This function can be used to transform or validate the response data.

```graphql showLineNumbers
type Query {
  user(id: Int!): User
    @http(
      url: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/{{.args.id}}"
      onResponseBody: "onResponse"
    )
}
```

## select

You can use `select` with mustache syntax to re-construct the directives
response to the desired format. This is useful when data are deeply
nested or want to keep specific fields only from the response.

- EXAMPLE 1: if we have a call that returns `{ "user": { "items": [...],
... } ... }` we can use `"{{.user.items}}"`, to extract the `items`.
- EXAMPLE 2: if we have a call that returns `{ "foo": "bar", "fizz": {
"buzz": "eggs", ... }, ... }` we can use `{ foo: "{{.foo}}", buzz:
"{{.fizz.buzz}}" }`

```graphql showLineNumbers
type Query {
  userCompany(id: Int!): Company
    @http(
      url: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/{{.args.id}}"
      select: "{{.company}}"
    )
  userDetails(id: Int!): UserDetails
    @http(
      url: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/{{.args.id}}"
      select: {
        id: "{{.id}}"
        city: "{{.address.city}}"
        phone: "{{.phone}}"
      }
    )
}
```

## dedupe

A boolean flag, if set to `true`, will enable deduplication of IO operations to enhance performance. This flag prevents duplicate IO requests from being executed concurrently, reducing resource load. If not specified, this feature defaults to `false`.

```graphql showLineNumbers
@http(
  url: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/"
  dedupe: true
)
```
